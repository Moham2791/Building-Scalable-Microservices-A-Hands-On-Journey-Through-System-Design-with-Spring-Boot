# Building Scalable Microservices: A Hands-On Journey Through System Design with Spring Boot

## Slide 1: Introduction
- **Title**: Welcome to Building Scalable Microservices
- **Content**:
  - Presenter: Your Name, Junior Backend Developer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and CISSP-inspired security practices.
  - Objective: Learn to build robust microservices with Spring Boot, applying system design principles.
  - Audience: Developers, architects, and enthusiasts (beginners to experts).
- **For Juniors**: "Think of microservices like a restaurant kitchen—each station (service) handles a specific task, working together to serve a meal (application)."
- **For Seniors**: Highlight alignment with industry standards (NIST, ISO) and real-world architectures.

## Slide 2: Project Overview
- **Content**:
  - Task Management System: User Service (user management), Task Service (task management), API Gateway.
  - Tech Stack: Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Keycloak (OAuth2), RabbitMQ, Eureka, Prometheus, Grafana, Zipkin.
- **Demo**: Show architecture diagram (prepared separately, e.g., using Draw.io).
  - **Juniors**: "The diagram is like a city map—services are neighborhoods, and the API Gateway is the main road directing traffic."
  - **Seniors**: Discuss CAP theorem trade-offs (favoring availability and partition tolerance with eventual consistency).

## Slide 3: Distributed Systems Fundamentals
- **Content**:
  - **Definition**: Multiple services working together (User Service, Task Service).
  - **Benefits**: Scalability, fault isolation, independent deployment.
  - **Example**: Netflix uses microservices for streaming and user management.
- **System Design Concepts** (from Google Sheet):
  - Availability, Reliability, Fault Tolerance: Ensured via circuit breakers and retries.
  - CAP Theorem: Project chooses AP (availability, partition tolerance) with eventual consistency via RabbitMQ.
- **For Juniors**: "Imagine a distributed system like a team of chefs—each works independently but must coordinate for the final dish."
- **For Seniors**: Reference PACELC theorem for trade-offs in latency vs. consistency.

## Slide 4: Security with OAuth2
- **Content**:
  - OAuth2 with Keycloak: Secure API access with JWT tokens.
  - RBAC: Admin vs. User roles for endpoint access.
  - CISSP Principles: Least privilege, defense-in-depth (TLS, JWT validation).
- **Demo**: Show Keycloak setup and token retrieval process.
- **For Juniors**: "OAuth2 is like a VIP pass—only authorized users get access to certain areas."
- **For Seniors**: Discuss NIST 800-53 controls (e.g., access control, authentication) and ISO 27001 compliance.

## Slide 5: Scalability and Load Balancing
- **Content**:
  - Horizontal Scaling: Multiple instances of User/Task Service with Eureka discovery.
  - Load Balancing: Spring Cloud LoadBalancer routes requests via API Gateway.
  - Traffic Patterns: Handles spiky loads with autoscaling (simulated in Docker).
- **Demo**: Show Eureka dashboard with registered services.
- **For Juniors**: "Scaling is like adding more cashiers during a busy sale to handle customers faster."
- **For Seniors**: Discuss vertical vs. horizontal scaling trade-offs and bottlenecks (e.g., database contention).

## Slide 6: Consistency and Concurrency
- **Content**:
  - Eventual Consistency: Task creation events via RabbitMQ ensure loose coupling.
  - ACID in PostgreSQL: Transactional integrity for user/task data.
  - Idempotency: Task Service checks for duplicate tasks.
- **For Juniors**: "Consistency is like making sure everyone gets the same menu at a restaurant, even if it takes a moment."
- **For Seniors**: Explain CRDTs (potential future enhancement) and vector clocks for conflict resolution.

## Slide 7: Fault Tolerance
- **Content**:
  - Circuit Breakers: Resilience4j in Task Service for User Service calls.
  - Retries: Automatic retries with exponential backoff.
  - Chaos Engineering: Simulate User Service failure to show fallback.
- **Demo**: Stop User Service container to trigger circuit breaker.
- **For Juniors**: "A circuit breaker is like a fuse—it stops the system from crashing if something fails."
- **For Seniors**: Reference Netflix’s Hystrix and chaos engineering practices.

## Slide 8: Observability
- **Content**:
  - Metrics: Prometheus scrapes actuator endpoints for CPU/memory usage.
  - Tracing: Zipkin tracks request flows across services.
  - Dashboards: Grafana visualizes metrics (e.g., request latency).
- **Demo**: Show Grafana dashboard and Zipkin traces.
- **For Juniors**: "Observability is like a car’s dashboard—it shows you what’s happening under the hood."
- **For Seniors**: Discuss distributed tracing for debugging microservices and SLIs/SLOs.

## Slide 9: Live Demo
- **Content**:
  - Create a user (POST /users with OAuth2 token).
  - Create a task (POST /tasks).
  - Show Zipkin trace for request flow.
  - Display Grafana metrics for service health.
- **For Juniors**: Walk through each step slowly, explaining inputs and outputs.
- **For Seniors**: Highlight OAuth2 token validation and sharding strategy.

## Slide 10: Real-World Case Study
- **Content**:
  - Compare to Uber: Microservices for user management, trip processing, and payment.
  - Lessons: Loose coupling, fault tolerance, and observability are critical.
- **For Juniors**: "Uber’s app is like our project—many small services working together to book a ride."
- **For Seniors**: Discuss Uber’s use of Ringpop for service discovery and our Eureka equivalent.

## Slide 11: Q&A and Closing
- **Content**:
  - Invite questions from audience.
  - Recap key takeaways: OAuth2 security, scalability, fault tolerance, observability.
  - Share contact info and GitHub repo for the project.
- **For Juniors**: Encourage experimenting with the code locally.
- **For Seniors**: Invite feedback on advanced topics like CRDTs or chaos engineering.
